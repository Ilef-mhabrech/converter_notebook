Professional insertion: research & development processes in company processes. Goals and organisation of the scientific research community
Writing a scientific bibliography Writing and presenting for research
Designing and interpreting experimental work Ethics of research
The student will also carry out a project (miniature internship) in the field of data science (various topics will be proposed by the faculty teaching in the master), with emphasis on problem formalisation and bibliography, and light experimentation.

    ns1:content """
Prerequisites : linear algebra, probability, statistics
Not mandatory (they will be partly covered during the first courses) but valuable : basic machine learning (classification, regression), convex optimization
1. Intro [Motivation, definitions, terminology, review linear algebra, probability and optimization, regression]
2. Subspace learning [principal component analysis (PCA), statistical and geometrical viewpoint, indep. component analysis (ICA)]
4. Manifold learning [MDS, ISOMAP, t-sne and other unsupervised manifold methods]
5. Deep learning [restricted Boltzmann machines, auto encoders, deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrrent neural networks]
6. Metric learning [(non)-linear, global/local, constraints setting, structured data]
Project : Students should form groups of 2-4 members. A list of candidate papers will be posted, and each group should pick one from the list. Each group is required to give an oral presentation about the content of the paper in the last two weeks, and submit a report at the end. The report should include at the minimum a summary of the method/framework, and experimental results obtained by playing the code published along with the paper. Division of work should be determined by the members.
Grading will be based on a project assignment (50%) and a final exam (50%).

Upon completion, the student will
- face the problem of human crafted features and observe the benefit of automatic feature learning
- understand cutting edge representation learning algorithms applied in data science
- know how to use representation learning methods that scale well on a variety of (un)labeled, (multi)-modal, relational and heterogeneous data.
- be able to tackle a new data given by an application or a new problem described in a scientific paper, and apply the aforementionned methods on it
