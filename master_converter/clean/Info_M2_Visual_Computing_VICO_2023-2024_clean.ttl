Discrete geometry topics :
• Discrete topology
• Discrete line, surface and volume
• Mathematical morphology
• Discrete measures
• Discrete reconstruction
Image analysis applications topics:
• medical imaging
• materials imaging
• art imaging
""" ;
    ns1:level "Master" ;
    ns1:semester "3" ;
    ns1:objective """
At the end of this course, the students will be able to:
• Understand the digital objects that constitutes the basis for computation in any image field. Discrete topology theorems, algorithms for line drawing, convex shape or distance maps, morphological tools and discrete reconstruction are presented in order to be able to manage an image problem via these tools
• Manipulate the discrete geometry concepts in a real applicative environment either for medical imaging (image acquisition, tomography, quantizing image information) or for image analysis (medical, materials, ...). A large set of examples is available from the teams projects and are applied with the previous concepts in real time constraints environments
